Besides my [CV]({{ "/cv" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), here you could find some interesting info about myself.
Not everything is about [coding][github] (but mostly!). I have also other interests as [Traveling][travel-blog], watching [Series and Movies][traktv] or [Playing videogames][steam]. And I love [Music][lastfm] too! <strike>I have a Flickr account for my photos, but it's outdated</strike>([link][flickr]).
<br>
I have a strange obsession _recording_ everything I do on internet, but then it allows me to look back and remember it with great detail.

I was born in the '90s in **Málaga** (South of Spain). I really love this city, but my heart doesn't belong here.
I'm currently studying a Bachelor of _Software Engineering_ at Málaga's University, and I had a High-Level Technical Degree in _"Computer Systems Administration"_.
I love almost everything, like I said before. And I'll never give up to keep learning!
