#Hello World!

This is my first post here, using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) for running and hosting this blog.

I've been looking for a custom way to make my own web page and also have my own blog, and I found this powerful tool that also brings me the possibility to write in **Markdown**.
