#Hello World!

This is my first post here, using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com "Transform your plain text into static websites and blogs.") and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com "Websites for you and your projects.") for running and hosting this blog.

I've been looking for a custom way to make my own web page and also having my own blog, and I found this powerful tool that also brings me the possibility to write in **Markdown**.
