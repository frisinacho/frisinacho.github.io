#Hello World!

This is my first post here, using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com "Transform your plain text into static websites and blogs.") and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com "Websites for you and your projects.") for running and hosting this blog.

I've been looking for a custom way to make my own web page and also having my own blog, and I found this powerful tool that also allows me to write in **Markdown**.

I <strike>(needed)</strike> *wanted* to have a personal web where I could upload my own *CV* and a little excerpt about what I'm doing or what I'm capable of.
