First month in Sweden. First of the 4 month I'll be doing this internship (within a month of Christmas holidays).
First of all, I want to thanks **Telefónica** and **Ericsson** for this awesome opportunity which I will take full advantage.
It just appeared, I didn't expect it... but I got an email, and since that particular moment I haven't thought anything but come here!
And Sweden it's not just one of my favourite countries in the world, but it's one of the best places to work as a _developer_, and Ericsson gives me the chance to improve myself as much as I want!

One month has already passed, and it just remain two more months... But I'm quite sure that it will be amazing!
A lot of projects to develop, and too many things to learn! (Obviously, I'd love to stay here for much more time, but that's not in my hand).
I will try very hard to stay in Stockholm after the internship, even if it's not possible to continue in Ericsson.

It's hard to leave the family and friends away, but it's for a good reason and I hope they understand and receive me with open arms when I come back.
(At least I've this little break for Christmas in Madrid to see my family and enjoy one week with them, and other week in Málaga to see my friends)
