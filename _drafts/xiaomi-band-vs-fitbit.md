I've been wearing this new brand [Xiaomi Mi Band][xiaomi] for a few months now, and I must say that it's amazing.
I had other _smartband_ ([Fitbit Charge][fitbit]) before this one, and now I also have an _smartwatch_ ([Moto 360][moto]). But I just want to talk about the similarities and differences between these two smartbands.

First of all, I have to admit that I bought the **Fitbit Charge** with the intention of being more active. I wanted a way to keep logged all my steps and my sport activity, and this band offered me everything I needed: Simplicity, comfort and good performance.
Apparently it was a good choice... But the often synchronization problems, low resistance and _low battery_ made the smartband something uncomfortable to wear.
